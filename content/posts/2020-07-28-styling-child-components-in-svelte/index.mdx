excerpt: How to style child components without changing their implementation or leaking styles to the rest of your app.
---

In Svelte, we normally want components to [be their own boss](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/pull/22#issuecomment-664047806), which means we shouldn't mess with their styling. But if you can't change the child component's implementation and you need it to look different, the [`:global(...)`](https://svelte.dev/docs#style) modifier is the right tool for the job.

# What we're going to build

We'll build a little color palette display, with colors taken from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/181883).

<iframe
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    maxWidth: '744px',
    border: 'none',
    boxShadow:
      '0 30px 60px -10px rgba(0,0,0,0.3), 0 18px 36px -18px rgba(0,0,0,0.33)',
    margin: '15px auto 50px'
  }}
  src={
    'https://svelte.dev/repl/6fbc80ba9fe944d0a9c09023c4485247?version=3.24.0'
  }
/>

# Our components

Each color in our palette is represented by an instance of the ColorSwatch class, which is a very simple creature. By default it just renders a 50x50 div:

```html
<!-- ColorSwatch.svelte -->

<style>
  .color-swatch {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
  }
</style>

<div class="color-swatch"></div>
```

But our outer component is a little more interesting:

```html
<!-- App.svelte -->

<style>
  :global(.container > *) {
    height: 25% !important;
    width: 100% !important;
  }

  :global(.container > :nth-child(1)) {
    background: #eb6383;
  }

  /* etc */
</style>

<div class="container">
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
</div>
```

Notice how we're targeting our color swatches: `:global(.container > *)`. It uses Svelte's :global(...) modifier so that the rule affects elements outside the current component, but we limit its influence with the .container class and the CSS [child combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) (>). We use the [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) (\*) to target _any_ of our container's direct children, which lets us pretend a little ignorance of our child components' markup.

# _Really_ preventing style leak

If we used a class called "container" elsewhere in our app, our global rule could still leak out and wreak havoc on our carefully crafted UI. If we're concerned about that, we can [manually generate](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) a unique identifier and append it to our container class, like so:

```html
<!-- App.svelte -->

<style>
  :global(.container-bacf979e > *) {
    height: 25% !important;
    width: 100% !important;
  }

  :global(.container-bacf979e > :nth-child(1)) {
    background: #eb6383;
  }

  /* etc */
</style>

<div class="container-bacf979e">
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
  <ColorSwatch />
</div>
```
